Hi, I’m Ben (@benjamin-j-cooper). I recently completed an MS degree at the University of Minnesota, I am learning to fit machine learning models in the Applied Data Science certificate program through MIT Professional Education, and I am transitioning from genomics/bioinformatics to a career in applied data science! I'm broadly interested in data science and using data science, AI, and ML tools to support innovation. You can find me on LinkedIn at [benjamin-joel-cooper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-joel-cooper/).
