Hi, I’m Ben (@benjamin-j-cooper). I recently graduated with an MS degree from the University of Minnesota, completed the Applied Data Science certificate program through MIT Professional Education in the top 1% of learners, and I am transitioning from genomics/bioinformatics to a career in data engineering/data science/python application development! I'm broadly interested in data, cloud tools, AI, ML, and innovation. You can find me on LinkedIn at [benjamin-joel-cooper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-joel-cooper/).
