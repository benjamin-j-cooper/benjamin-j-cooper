Hi, I’m Ben (@benjamin-j-cooper). I recently completed an MS degree at the University of Minnesota, I am learning to fit machine learning models in the Applied Data Science certificate program through MIT Professional Education, and I am transitioning from genomics/bioinformatics to a career in applied data science! I'm broadly interested in data science and using data and ML tools to support growth in renewables, the carbon economy, and sustainable agriculture. You can find me on LinkedIn at [benjamin-joel-cooper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-joel-cooper/).
